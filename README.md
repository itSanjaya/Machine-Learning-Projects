# Machine-Learning-Projects

### This repository contains machine learning projects implemented from scratch. These projects are part of the Applied Machine Learning course. Each project focuses on building machine learning algorithms without relying on high-level machine learning libraries. Instead, I used foundational tools and implement algorithms step-by-step to gain a deeper understanding of their inner workings.
